<p class="has-drop-cap">The ‘Lighthouse Projects’ are in the clinical disciplines of the chronic diseases Epilepsy, Haemophilia and Bipolar Disorder. The epilepsy Lighthouse project is a partnership between a number of organisations – RSCI, HSE, eHealth Ireland, Epilepsy Ireland, Beaumont Hospital and Ergo. There are many positive outcomes and benefits for patients as well as healthcare professionals associated with using information technology within health.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Challenge</h4>



<p>Providing Individualised Services and Care in Epilepsy (PISCES) is a Lighthouse Project with a number of partners including HSE, eHealth Ireland, Epilepsy Ireland, RCSI and Beaumont. In the past there was no way for patients, academics or clinicians around Ireland to record their medical details electronically which created numerous problems.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Solution</h4>



<p>The PISCES Project is about using technologies to promote a model of precision, proactive and personalised healthcare for the more than 40,000 people with epilepsy across Ireland. The solution developed is an Electronic Patient Record (EPR) and Patient Portal App focused exclusively on the needs of epilepsy patients. The patient portal is a mobile-first, cloud-based solution. No matter where care is delivered, information can be collected, added to the care record and accessed by the care team regardless of geographic location or care setting. The project also involves the development of a BI solution which enables clinicians to securely use aggregated patient data to analyse and gather insights for the wider patient community to inform future care and population health.</p>



<p>Clinicians now have a streamlined view of patient information through the Electronic Patient Record (EPR) – a single source of truth where all patient medical information can be recorded and accessed from anywhere nationwide. As part of the EPR, genetic data can be easily interpreted, and documenting decisions and agreed actions has been simplified.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Beaumont Hospital is a large academic teaching hospital 5km north of Dublin City centre. They provide emergency and acute care services across 54 medical specialties to a local community of some 290,000 people, while employing over 3,000 staff.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Challenge</h4>



<p>An inefficient filing system at Beaumont hindered healthcare workers who needed to be able to access patient records quickly and easily. Staff reverted to keeping paper records that were stored off-site. If a doctor or nurse needed to see them for a returning patient or if they were needed for a legal claim, then the file had to be physically retrieved from the archive and collected by courier; a time consuming process.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Solution</h4>



<p>With Ergo’s Scan &amp; Index Manager documents were digitised and indexed in Microsoft SharePoint for easy search and retrieval. Implementation was risk-free and well planned because Ergo built the system at its headquarters first, replicating the Beaumont environment off-site before deploying it into the hospital.</p>



<p>The implementation of Ergo’s Scan and Index Manager system has delivered tangible productivity gains and cost savings for Beaumont Hospital. Doctors, nurses and administrators have robust systems that enable them to retrieve files in around 10 seconds compared to 30 minutes with the old system.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Berman Bedding, Inc. has been in business since 1912. But when this mattress manufacturer started producing medical pads in the 1950s, it realized the need for efficient technology solutions to keep its factories humming. Operations have changed drastically in the last 60 years, and when Berman President Robert Unger realized he couldn’t be the company’s IT guy anymore, he called CMIT Solutions</p>



<p>With so much at stake, they turned to NanoSoft Solutions to handle their IT needs. NanoSoft not only created detailed plan to upgrade MCMS systems, but when an old modem died over a weekend, putting in jeopardy the MCMS e-mail capabilities, it was NanoSoft who came to the rescue. As Christopher Bell from MCMS says:</p>



<p>It’s that 24 hour/7 day a week support and commitment to service that keeps the MCMS from worrying anymore about their IT.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Located in the rich fertile Golden Valleys of Munster, Dairygold has a long and proud history of producing quality-assured, sustainable gold standard cheese and dairy ingredients. With three imperative divisions that drive and support our farmers and business, Dairygold are able to offer clients and consumers full traceability, unrivalled quality and product excellence.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Challenge</h4>



<p>The central focus of a new CRM system was to allow Dairygold to improve customer and supplier relationships. The Co-Operative was previously dependent of on field staff returning to the office to file a paper-based records of customer interactions.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Solution</h4>



<p>Designed and delivered by Ergo, the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) components in Microsoft Dynamics 365 were identified as the best way to meet Dairygold&#8217;s requirements and to garner a better understanding of farmers and their needs. The new CRM system provides Dairygold with relevant information in a timely manner helping to overcome some of the challenges the teams have encountered when working remotely in rural Ireland.</p>



<p>Ergo’s CRM solution has allowed Dairygold to record important items of information, enabling a more enhanced service. All the information is uploaded directly by their staff from any location, solving the challenge of working with customers and suppliers in remote areas.</p>
